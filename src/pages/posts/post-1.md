# Welcome to my _very first blog_ post! 

## First and foremost

This site is created solely for educational purposes. 
I wanted to practice my rusty programming skills, hence, this project came to life!

This blog site also serves as a way to _**store my thoughts online**_!

I'm glad that I've discovered Astro framework making it easier to build sites like this from scratch!

<br />

## What can I expect with this blog site?

As I've said earlier, this serve as a place where I can store my thoughts online! Maybe I'll write things that I learn along the way. Maybe I'll write things that I **like** and **enjoy**. 

Additionally, I would also like to improve this site over time (_responsive design ehem_) so I guess I can also document my progress here.


<br />


## What's next?

As you can see, this site is still a WIP and still has a long way to go. I'll use this as a way to practice and hone my web dev skills.
