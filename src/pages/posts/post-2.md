# Welcome to Hell!!!

## The scorching heat

It has been so hot lately, with temps reaching up to 33Â°C (are we in hell already?!).

I haven't got the time to update this blog-site project since I've been so busy with my current engagement at work and this heat does not help at all!!!!

It's really hard to focus on working and finishing tasks during this season, luckily, my current engagement is 'bout to end (wohoo, back to more coding this time --- _hope so, hope so_). Now I am currently setting up my work laptop for a new engagement --- but this project is using Java which I do not have experience with as of the moment.

Hopefully **fingers-crossed* I'll learn something new in this engagement.

<br />

## Next Steps

Going back to this blog-site project of mine, I'm looking forward to applying these in the next few days:
- uniform layout for all the current pages that I have so far (home, about, blog)
- responsive design (using media queries)
- implement scripts for this site (I guess I should start with basic button that changes the theme to dark or light)


<br />

## Parting words

There's so much more to improve to this site, I know, so please bear with me ^_^
Anyway, here's a band that I'm currently hooked as of the moment --- have a listen :) (*god, they're so good*)
